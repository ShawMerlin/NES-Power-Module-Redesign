The below improvements have been made to Version 2.0v over our last release of 1.8v. <br>

Updates 2/14/2023 <br>
          - Upgraded the Full Bridge Rectifier to one that can do 5 Amps.  The old version was getting pretty warm. <br>
          - Beefier DC Input Jack that can handle 5 Amps (old one could only do 2.5 amps) <br>
          - This Board has been tested pulling 3 Amps max without issue. <br>
          - Ground stitching over audio traces to help prevent any static and noise that would be coming from the Buck Converter. <br>
          - The Power LED turns on now when the Solder Bridge has been made.  Meaning it can be disabled by removing the bridge. <br>
          - Most all parts are SMD now and made easy for an Assembly House like JLCPCB to build the PCB and Assemble for you. <br>
          - BOM and POS files are included that Assembly Houses will need. <br> <br>
