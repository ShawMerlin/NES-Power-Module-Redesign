- Version 1.8 - Increased the Ground Stitching around the Video Trace and added Ground Stitching to the Audio Trace.

I have uploaded the Gerbers for this board and also a Bill of Materials and Position File.
You can use both these .CSV files to have JLCPCB provide and Assemble the SMD parts for you.
