- 10/18/2022 - The YPbPr Component board has to have the 3.5mm jack changed positions.  The case doesn't quite have a low enough lip to
 support it and I want to keept his a No-Cut Mod.  I plan on putting it up where the old Video Out use to be and will upload photo's when I have this completed.

- 9/22/2022 - Working on a Classic and 'Y'Pb'Pr "Component" Version that uses the LDO instead of the Switching Voltage Regulator.  

  Lots of heat but I have some ideas on how to handle it.

- 9/17/2022 - I tested the Component (Y/pB/pR) circuit with the NESRGB Board and it looked great!!  I have these new PCBs on order

- 9/12/2022 - I found a couple of issues on the Sound and RGB Board which are being fixed.  The Classic and THT Versions are still good.
 Added new concept of a Component Output board and created a folder for it with Pictures.

- 9/10/2022 - Sound Mix board needed a couple of small changes but the RGB, DIY THT, and new HDMI Companion board are working great!!
 I will be updating the folders on this github with those gerber files too.

  I have also ordered the Soundmix and RGB Boards.
- 7/02/2022 - Prototypes for the Classic Power Module with Composite Video were successful!!
