# Updates
- 4/10/2023 - New RGBNES Companion PWR Boards Version 2.1 are completed and fully tested.(I will upload design files shortly) <br>
            - Still working on the 5.2V Clamp on the USB Boards to send all voltages above 5.2V to GND and trip a resettable fuse. <br>

- 3/31/2023 - New RCA Classic Modules v2.1 have been tested and are working great. <br>
Features a 1.9A fuse to help protect the circuit and main NES Board, input inductor, Diode Rectifier and more filtering capacitors <br>
- 3/13/2023 - The NES NESRGB "Companion" Power Module is completed and tested.  Files released under this github. <br>
- 2/14/2023 - DIY Boards have tested good with a 2 amp load for 24 hours.  I updated a footprint and added some warning graphics to the board.  Gerbers files have been released. <br>
- 2/12/2023 - The DIY Board has arrived and it has been assembled. Testing will finish up tonight and I will release the Kicad/Gerber files once testing is done. <br>
- 2/12/2023 - The Vertical USB C proved to not be the most solid or stable when I was stress testing it with twisting and plugging in the cable. This has been replaced. <br>
- 2/12/2023 - The 'Y'Pb'Pr Component output board is working but is oversaturated on the blue channel.  More research is being done. <br>
- 2/12/2023 - NES RGB Gen2 Power Module is currently in-transit. I will be testing this as soon as it arrives.


- 2/1/2023 - Getting back on the horse!! I have NES RGB Gen2 Power Module Version 1.9 completed and ordered. I should be able to test within a couple of weeks. 
  This new version has slide    switches instead of header jumpers and I have also changed the pinout on the 7 pin connector to match the color of wires.

- 2/1/2023 - Redesigned the THT DIY Board so that it uses a LDO once again and uploaded the BOM files.  Testing the PCB is our next step.

- 1/8/2022 I have added to my designs a USB C Powered Module (This was long overdue).
  This module uses Power Delivery to get up to 3 amps of 5V Power from a USB Power Brick.
  It does not need to coverted down to 5V so no buck converters or LDO's needed!!
  
- 10/18/2022 - The YPbPr Component board has to have the 3.5mm jack changed positions.  The case doesn't quite have a low enough lip to
 support it and I want to keept his a No-Cut Mod.  I plan on putting it up where the old Video Out use to be and will upload photo's when I have this completed.

- 9/22/2022 - Working on a Classic and 'Y'Pb'Pr "Component" Version that uses the LDO instead of the Switching Voltage Regulator.  

  Lots of heat but I have some ideas on how to handle it.

- 9/17/2022 - I tested the Component (Y/pB/pR) circuit with the NESRGB Board and it looked great!!  I have these new PCBs on order

- 9/12/2022 - I found a couple of issues on the Sound and RGB Board which are being fixed.  The Classic and THT Versions are still good.
 Added new concept of a Component Output board and created a folder for it with Pictures.

- 9/10/2022 - Sound Mix board needed a couple of small changes but the RGB, DIY THT, and new HDMI Companion board are working great!!
 I will be updating the folders on this github with those gerber files too.

- 8/24/2022 - Uploaded BOM, Gerber and Kicad Files for the DIY THT Classic RCA Power Module. 
- 8/22/2022 - Starting tests on the Sound Mix and RGB Edition.
  
  I have also added a new version below for the HDMI Hi-Def Mod.
- 7/13/2022 - First Production batch of Classic Power Module arrived.  Kicad files available and uploaded!

  I have also ordered the Soundmix and RGB Boards.
- 7/02/2022 - Prototypes for the Classic Power Module with Composite Video were successful!! 
  
  Gerbers, Bill of Materials and Assemly Position files have been uploaded above.
- 6/19/2022 - Replaced the LDO with a Switching Voltage Regulator for a low heat alternative.  New boards ordered. Expected by 6/27.
- 5/30/2022 - BOM created for Classic RCA Power Board and Uploaded, boards expected by 6/3.
- 5/17/2022 - Both Classic and Classic with Sound AMP PCBs have been ordered for testing.  
- Once verified, the open source files will be released.
