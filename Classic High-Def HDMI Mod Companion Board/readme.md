For the lucky few that got the NES HDMI Board while it was available, there is an option for it with our boards.
The NES HDMI Board uses the 9v input instead of the 5v regulated so there is no voltage regulator on this board.


Large Postive and Negative pads to make it easy to connect wires directly to the HDMI Board.
