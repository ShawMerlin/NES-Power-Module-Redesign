The original NES Power Module from the 80's is very noisy.  The Power Traces cross eachother and the ground home path is messy.
EMI was not a worry in 1985 but noise can impact picture and sound quality

# Goals with these new NES Power Modules
- Full Ground Plane that is uninterrupted and is free of traces and components.
- Power Traces that do not cross and have the GND plane below for a good return power signal.
- Have a specific NES Power Module for each use case (not try and pile everything into one board)

# Below is an example of the Orignal Power Module.  Notice how the power traces keep crossing eachother and other components. Folks really didn't consider EMI a lot back then and opted to just cover the entire board in a metal shroud.
