# NES-Power-Module-Redesign
Completely Redesigning the NES Power Module to Reduce Noise and EMI

The original NES Power Module is very noisy.  The Power Traces cross eachother and the ground home path is messy.
EMI was not a worry in 1985 but noise can impact picture and sound quality

# Updates
- 7/02/2022 - Prototypes for the Classic Power Module with Composite Video were successful!! 
  Gerbers, Bill of Materials and Assemly Position files have been uploaded above.
- 6/19/2022 - Replaced the LDO with a Switching Voltage Regulator for a low heat alternative.  New boards ordered. Expected by 6/27.
- 5/30/2022 - BOM created for Classic RCA Power Board and Uploaded, boards expected by 6/3.
- 5/17/2022 - Both Classic and Classic with Sound AMP PCBs have been ordered for testing.  
- Once verified, the open source files will be released.


# Goals with these new NES Power Modules
- Full Ground Plane that is uninterrupted and is free of traces and components.
- Power Traces that do not cross and have the GND plane below for a good return power signal.
- Have a specific NES Power Module for each use case (not try and pile everything into one board)

# Ideas of Boards to design
- NES Classic Power Module
- NES Classic Power Module with Sound Amp
- NES RGB Power Module (for use with the NESRGB Board)
