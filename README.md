# NES Revival - Power-Module Redesign
Completely Redesigning the NES Power Module to Reduce Noise and EMI

I have more of the Classic RCA Boards available on my Ebay - https://www.ebay.com/itm/144936529192 <br>
Project Guardian is a Design Partner, he has these available for Canada/Europe. - https://www.ebay.ca/itm/175646079411 <br> <br>

I will also have the new USB C Powered prototype available if anyone is interested.  Just sent me a message.

The original NES Power Module is very noisy.  The Power Traces cross eachother and the ground home path is messy.
EMI was not a worry in 1985 but noise can impact picture and sound quality

# Goals with these new NES Power Modules
- Full Ground Plane that is uninterrupted and is free of traces and components.
- Power Traces that do not cross and have the GND plane below for a good return power signal.
- Have a specific NES Power Module for each use case (not try and pile everything into one board)

# Below is an example of the Orignal Power Module.  Notice how the power traces keep crossing eachother and other components. Folks really didn't consider EMI a lot back then and opted to just cover the entire board in a metal shoud.
