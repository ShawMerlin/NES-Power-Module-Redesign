Gerbers, BOM and POS (JLCPCB Assembly) will be available after testing is completed.

2/1/2023 - Getting back on the horse!!  I have Version 1.9 completed and ordered. I should be able to test within a couple of weeks.
This new version has slide switches instead of header jumpers and I have also changed the pinout on the 7 pin connector to match the color of wires.

9/12/2022 - I have made a couple of changes to the RGB Board, I have moved the 9 pin Genesis Connector closer and fixed part of the audio circuit.
The Gerber files have been taken down until we get this new one tested.

Key Features on this board.
- Seperate Ground Plane from the 5V Regulator and the RGB Traces.  2 Grounding points on the Board. 
- Switching Voltage Regulator. 
- Physical cut outs in the PCB board to help shield against any EMI from the regulator.
- 1.5mm pitch 7 Pin Header that will fit a JST Connection - https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832866824604.html
- Switch for selection of Internal Audio or External Audio (if you have your own Audio Circuit)
- Switch for Selection of the Multi-Function RCA Jack to be Left (mono Audio) or Composite from the RGB Board.
- 3 Way Side Switch that can be wired into the Palette Selection on the RGB Board -
