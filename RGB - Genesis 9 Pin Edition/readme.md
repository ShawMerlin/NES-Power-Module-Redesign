# NES Revival RGBNES "Companion" Power Module.   <br>
(RGBNES Required for this No Cut Mod Board) <br>

3/13/2023
Gerbers, BOM and POS (JLCPCB Assembly) have been released and are on this github page. <br>



Key Features on this board.
- Seperate Ground Plane from the 5V Regulator and the RGB Traces.  2 Grounding points on the Board. 
- Switching Voltage Regulator. 
- Physical cut outs in the PCB board to help shield against any EMI from the regulator.
- Switch for selection of Internal Audio or External Audio (if you have your own Audio Circuit)
- Switch for Selection of the Multi-Function RCA Jack to be Left (mono Audio) or Composite from the RGB Board.
- 3 Way Side Switch that can be wired into the Palette Selection on the RGB Board -

Older History <br>

3/2/2023 - Testing is going good.  I am sending engineering samples to various testers in order to get feedback. <br> <br>

Final Revision for V2.0 that brings some quality of life updates. <br>
- Moved the Optional Power LED to a more central location.  <br>
- Changed the Pitch from JST XH 1.5mm to JST PH 2.0mm to make it a lot easier to solder without bridges.  <br>
- Rotated JST Connector so now a right angle one can be used.  <br>
- Gen2 Audio Output now is controlled by the Ext/Int Audio Switch. <br>
- Rotated the Palette Switch outputs for easier access. <br> <br>

2/28/2023 - Boards have arrived and are assembled.  I couldn't find my Gen2 9 Pin to SCART cable so I had to order a new one.  <br>
It sohuld arrive today and after testing is complete.  All files will be released on this github. <br>

2/1/2023 - Getting back on the horse!!  I have Version 1.9 completed and ordered. I should be able to test within a couple of weeks.
This new version has slide switches instead of header jumpers and I have also changed the pinout on the 7 pin connector to match the color of wires.

9/12/2022 - I have made a couple of changes to the RGB Board, I have moved the 9 pin Genesis Connector closer and fixed part of the audio circuit.
The Gerber files have been taken down until we get this new one tested.
