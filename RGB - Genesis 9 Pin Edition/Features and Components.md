## Legend   <Br>

1. This is the Multi-Out Jack.  It can output either Video or Audio depending on how the switch below is set. <Br>
    - The Colors don't matter as much but having Yellow for Video or White for Audio will help with confusion. <Br>
2. Having the switch selected left will output Audio on the Multi-Out Jack.  Having it Right will output Componsite Video. <Br>
    -  The Video is only fed from the Comp pin on the J8 JST Connector.  Future revisions will have an option for Internal Video. <Br>
    -  The Audio can be either Internal or External from the NESRGB Board using the J8 JST Ext Audio Pin. <Br>
3. This is outputs from the switch directly below that will send a GND signal through each Pin.  Use a 3 pin JST Connector to the Pallette on the RGBNES <Br>
4. This Solder Jumper is to enable the Power LED.  Remove the solder will disable the LED. <Br>
5. 9 Pin Gen2 Connector.  This directly outputs the input feeds from the J8 JST-PH Connector into a 9 Pin Gen2 cable. <Br>
6. J8 JST Connector (7 pins)  Available also as a right angle connector.  A 7 pin JST-PH Cable is used to connect this to the RGBNES. <Br>
7. Audio Selector.  This will choose if the Audio Output on the Red Audio Jack (and possible the white Multifunction Jack) if it's Internal or External from RGBNES. <Br>
