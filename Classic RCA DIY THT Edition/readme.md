1/28/2024 - Moved the NES GND Connection pad closer to the LDO  

1/20/2024 - Complete Redesign on Version 3.0 to get the LDO back to where it is on the original Power Module. <br>
This will allow for the orignal Heatsink to be used or Regulator TSR2-2450 if no Heatsink is wanted. <br>
Extra Modifications for a Common Mode Choke and Bypass Capacitors on 5V Out to help reduce all Noise. <br>

 <br>
 I added a Low Cost tab in the BOM if noise is not as big of a concern.  Savings is about $5 from selecting these parts.  <br>

2/14/2023 - Minor changes to V1.3 including a correction in one of the capacitor values on the silkscreen and putting hot indicators <br>
          - Gerbers are now available that can be used at your favorite PCB Fab House. <br> <br>
