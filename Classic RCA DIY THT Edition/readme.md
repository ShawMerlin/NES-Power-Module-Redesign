# NES Revival PWR Board DIY Edition

A DIY NES Power Module for at home assembly that uses a LDO instead of a buck converter to get the voltage to 5V <br>

1/20/2024 - Complete Redesign on Version 3.0 to get the LDO back to where it is on the original Power Module. <br>
This will allow for the orignal Heatsink to be used or Regulator TSR2-2450 if no Heatsink is wanted. <br>
Extra Modifications for a Common Mode Choke and Bypass Capacitors on 5V Out to help reduce all Noise. <br>

2/14/2023 - Minor changes to V1.3 including a correction in one of the capacitor values on the silkscreen and putting hot indicators <br>
          - Gerbers are now available that can be used at your favorite PCB Fab House. <br> <br>
