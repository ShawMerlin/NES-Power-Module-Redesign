# NES Revival - Classic USB C Powered Module

This power board will work with both PD & Non-PD USB C.  Recommend at least a 1.5 AMP USB C if using Non-PD

We used the TUSB321RWBR IC for PD Negoations.  This will negotiate up to 3 amps depending on what PD charger is used.

This IC also is 5 volt only.  It will not negotiate any voltage about 5 volts so your equipment will always be in safe parameters.

Currently, I have tested the below Anker Power Block and USB-C Cable with 2-3 amps for several days with this board.  No Issues seen.
